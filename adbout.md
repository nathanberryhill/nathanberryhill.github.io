## Welcome to Nathan Berryhill's Github page!

#### A little bit about me:
I have lived in three states, including Texas where I have resided since 2005. I am currently attending The University of Texas at Austin majoring in Pure Mathematics.


I am a Lead Mentor in the Texas Interdisciplinary Program (TIP), an active member of the University Leadership Network, and am a member of Koinonia Christian Fellowship. 

One day, I hope to be a mathematics professor of some sort, probably in the field of differential equations or abstract algebra.

Things I love: fellowshipping over food, travelling, capturing memories via photos, and solving mathematics problems.

I plan to use this blog as a means to share my faith in Christ, thoughts, and any insightful knowledge.
