                                <h3 id="big">Criminal Justice Reform</h3>
                                <p id="p1">As a Christian, Nathan is guided by his faith in solving an issue as complex and heart-wrenching as criminal justice. Nathan believes justice is actually a faith position. Justice is righting wrongs and restoring good. Nathan believes in a good God who provides our standard for justice and mercy. Without God, there can be no justice. Crime hurts and justice should heal, and public safety should not be for sale in Texas.</p>
                                <p id="p2">As State Representative, Nathan will take the lead by reforming cash bail as we know it. Nathan believes bail reform is not just a left or right issue. He says there is common ground to be found - the Texas bail system is simply not equitable for our citizens because we find that those who don't have financial resources remain in jail, yet those who do have financial resources (and sometimes commit worse crimes) are allowed to be released. Not only is this unequal and discriminatory, this is a threat to our public safety - our bail system allows violent criminals to head back to the streets where they don't belong and become a threat to their victim and community.</p>
                                <h3 id="big2">Retribution vs. Rehabilitation</h3>
                                <p id="p3">In addition to our broken bail system, Nathan recognizes that we have a national drug problem and our prisons are being filled to the doors with nonviolent crimes. Nathan says a smart, 21st-Century solution to drug possession can solve our prison problem. We have to treat our drug problem as a public health crisis with people needing rehabilitation instead of an arrestable and jail-able offense. Working together, we can make the Texas system a shining beacon of smart, effective criminal justice that leads the nation.</p>

                                <p id="p1">All give some, but some give all. As the son of a late US Army soldier, Nathan completely understands the challenges our servicemembers and their families face. Nationally, 22 veterans or servicemembers commit suicide every day. Unfortunately, when Nathan was just 12 years old, his father became one of 22 in July 2009.</p>
                                <p id="p2">First and foremost, Nathan will work to expand access to mental health resources for servicemembers and their families. Current available resources and education are good but obviously not enough. Our veterans and servicemembers sacrifice their lives every day and some have paid the ultimate price. It is only fair we do the same for them.</p>

                                <h3 id="big">Higher Education</h3>
                                <p id="p1">Texas is the largest state by area in the contiguous United States and the second largest by population and economy. Nathan believes our students and universities should reflect achievements in our education and research. He will continue working to make Texas a national leader that all other states can imitate and follow.</p>
                                <p id="p2">Nathan will work to secure the funding necessary to keep our institutions of higher education great. In fact, the Texas Constitution requires that we have a university of the first-class. Texas deserves and expects nothing less. Nathan wants to secure extra funding to expand our already robust research so that colleges and universities can continue to do what they do great.</p>
                                <h3 id="big2">Free-Speech; Anti-Hazing Laws</h3>
                                <p id="p3">Our colleges and universities are bastions of thought &mdash; and that thought should be free. Nathan supports legislation to protect free-speech on our college campuses where ideas should be debated and respected. Nobody should be physically assaulted for their beliefs. Those who resort to violence usually are the ones who need to find a better argument rather than demand conformity.<br><br> Our colleges and universities priority should be on the students &mdash; our campuses have seen and reported too many students dying because of hazing activites occuring. Our campus policies 'say' hazing is not allowed, but we still hear too many stories of where our campus policies and leadership have failed our students and their families. Nathan will fight to protect our students so that they can be in an environment that they can thrive and study in.</p>

                                <h3 id="big">Elections and Redistricting</h3>
                                <p id="p1">The 87th Texas Legislature will be in charge of Redistricting following the 2020 Census. Redistricting consists of redrawing the district lines that are used for elections to the US House of Representatives and the Texas Legislature.</p>
                                <p id="p2">Nathan will fight for a fairer election and redistricting process. He wants 21st-Century solutions to voting applications and to voting itself. Nathan supports the fair measures of Voter ID laws &mdash; these types of laws are not meant to discriminate, but rather work to keep our elections fair so that those who vote are actually who they say they are. In Texas, you can already purchase various forms of identification for use at the polls. If you aren't able to afford one for purchase, the Department of Public Safety will happily issue a <b>free</b> ID Card specifcally for voting.</p>
                                <h3 id="big2">Fairness</h3>
                                <p id="p3">Nathan strives for fairness in all things &mdash; and redistricting is no exception. If elected, Nathan will work with legislators to end the practice of gerrymandering. Our redistricting process should be automatic, unbiased, and not hand-drawn to make our districts look like dragons. Instead of citizens choosing their politicians, gerrymandering allows politicians to choose their citizens. Gerrymandering isn't fair to anyone. Nathan believes everyone deserves to have a voice and representation.<br><br> There are open-source projects that, if elected, Nathan will consider drafting legislation to support. Of them are plans to keep our districts small, compact, and without regard to race or party affiliation.</p>

                                <h3 id="big">Government Transparency</h3>
                                <p id="p1">Nathan agrees with former President Abraham Lincoln &mdash; government should be of the people, by the people, and for the people. All citizens deserve to know the events and happenings of their government. That's why Nathan will stop every attempt at reducing transparency in government at all levels. Good legislators don't just pass laws, they also stop bad ones.</p>
                                <p id="p2">Nathan will also work to expand access and transparency at the State level. Currently, if a citizen wishes to testify and submit sworn statements, they would have to actually go to the State Capitol and voice their opinion on legislation. That means it is easier for someone who already lives in Austin to voice their opinion than, say, someone who lives in Amarillo, Texas. If elected, Nathan will support House Rules that would allow citizens to submit electronic statements or policy position to the Capitol or District offices of their state legislators. Everyone deserves to have a voice on an issue, not just those who have the means to travel.</p>
                                <h3 id="big2">Ban Taxpayer-Funded Lobbying</h3>
                                <p id="p3">Nathan will work to pass legislation that abolishes all forms of taxpayer-funded lobbying. Currently, political subdivisions may spend public funds to hire lobbyists for the purpose of supporting or opposing measures under consideration by the state legislature.<br><br>According to the Texas Ethics Commission, political subdivisions spent an estimated $16 million on lobbyist compensation in 2015 alone. Nathan believes the public has every right to know what their locally elected officials and associations could be using their taxpayer dollars for &mdash; some directly or indirectly influence the legislative process against the best interests of the Texans they represent. Nathan will do everything he can to ensure that the public trust is never broken and do away with taxpayer-funded lobbying.</p>

                                <p id="p1">If Congress refuses to act, Texas must. The US-Mexico border is the most frequently crossed border in the world by annual documented crossings. Texas has the longest stretch of the border with Mexico. 14 of 23 border counties in the US are located in Texas and almost two-thirds of the US-Mexico border belongs to Texas. Like it or not, this issue affects Texas significantly more than any other state.</p>
                                <p id="p2">Congress refuses to secure the border &mdash; so Texas will act and the federal government is going to pay for it! I agree with our Governor on this issue. Governor Abbott has already taken measures to secure the border, including deploying 1,000 National Guardsmen to assist the Customs and Border Patrol. Texans can't wait for Congress to act. Nathan and Governor Abbott aren't going to stand idly by.</p>
                                <h3 id="big2">Public Safety, Technology, and Human Trafficking</h3>
                                <p id="p3">The border issue is more than just about a physical border, independent of what President Trump or Congress wants. Border Security is connected to public safety, human, and drug trafficking. Nathan will work to enhance our technology usage at the border so that we can finally put an end to the heinous and evil form of modern-day human slavery.</p>

                                <h3 id="big">Public Education Funding that Lasts</h3>
                                <p id="p1">The 86th Legislature passed House Bill 3, school finance reform that increased the basic student allotment and attendace-based funding, increased pay for our school teachers and librarians across the board, and allows school districts to implement merit-based pay programs. Nathan supports all of these measures, especially since public school finance formulas have not changed in over 30 years! However, Nathan does not agree with how legislators agreed to pay for it. Instead of building and implementing a fiscally responsible budget, legislators decided to raid some of the Texas Economic Stabilization Fund, also known as the 'Texas Rainy Day Fund'. Legislators also contemplated raising the State Sales Tax by 16% to pay for it &mdash; Nathan thinks that is nothing short of irresponsible governing.</p>
                                <p id="p2">Nathan will always fight for low taxes and will never even consider voting to increase the state Sales Tax, which would make Texas have one of the highest base sales tax rates in the nation. In fact, Nathan would like to see the state Sales Tax decrease, not increase. Nathan believes responsible government and responsible legislators will not vote or consider increasing the sales tax. Ronald Reagan said it best, 'We don't have a revenue problem, we have a spending problem.' Since the 86th Legislature decided to raid part of the Rainy Day Fund to pay for this, future sessions like the 87th won't have ways to maintain nearly the same level of funding without some changes. Nathan wants to build a budget with school finance reform that lasts.</p>
                                <h3 id="big2">Protect Rainy Day Funds</h3>
                                <p id="p3">Nathan will work day in and day out to protect the Texas Rainy Day Fund and make sure it is only used for proper one-time expenses. The Rainy Day Fund is like a state savings account. The Rainy Day Fund is meant to help assist in paying for unprecedented expenses, like Hurricane Harvey Reconstruction. Nathan thinks that Hurricane Harvey is a great example &mdash; if we don't use the funds to pay for something like Hurricane Harvey, then Nathan doesn't know what we'd use it for.</p>

                                <h3 id="big">Reducing Property Taxes</h3>
                                <p id="p1">Nathan is committed to reducing the property tax burden on homeowners and businesses. The 86th Legislature passed Senate Bill 2 which reduces the rollback rate for certain taxing districts (like cities, counties, and school districts) &mdash; a rate of increase which the taxing unit cannot exceed unless approved by voters at the ballot box. Nathan agrees with the overall idea that if a taxing unit wants more of your hard-earned dollars, they should take it up with you and ask for your approval &mdash; it's your money after all. However, Nathan says we can and we must do more because Senate Bill 2 is just not enough.</p>
                                <p id="p2">Senate Bill 2 only slows the growth of property taxes over time, but it does nothing to actually reduce property taxes. That's why Nathan will continue the fight for real relief. The real culprit? Rising property valuations and appraisals. Nathan will draft, support, and vote for legislation that will reform the skyrocketing appraisal values across Texas.</p>
                                <h3 id="big2">Providing Real Relief</h3>
                                <p id="p3">Property valuations have been the loophole that our taxing districts have used and are using to increase revenue. While on paper tax rates might be descreasing, people are still seeing their property taxes increase. This is only possible if a taxing unit changes their appraisal formula. While rates may appear to be decreasing, property valuations and appraisals are able to increase in magnitude, which makes for an overall increase in the tax bill. Nathan will fight to close this loophole and provide real relief for Texans and their families.</p>

                                <h3 id="big">Texas Energy</h3>
                                <p id="p1">Nathan has just 5 simple words for the energy sector &mdash; Texas is OPEN FOR BUSINESS! Nathan will fight for Texas to be THE state for energy diversity and production. Nathan wants to remove the red tape to allow for energy sources of all kinds, whether it is wind, solar, coal, natural gas, or even Thorium-based nuclear energy. If it is cheap, efficient, reliable, and can help meet our energy needs for the 21st Century, Nathan is not opposed. He knows Texas needs a pro-business, all-of-the-above approach.</p>
                                <p id="p2">If our country does not diversify our energy portfolio, our economy could be crippled by rising prices or dwindling supply of one energy source. That's why Nathan will support legislation that works to expand access, production, and delivery of all forms of energy. We must be able to use all forms of energy for an economy to remain strong for Texans and their families.</p>
                                <h3 id="big2">Pro-Business Approach</h3>
                                <p id="p3">You may have heard of a proposal in Congress called the 'Green New Deal' but this 'deal' is complete nonsense. Nathan believes in a pro-consumer and pro-business approach. That means Nathan wants all forms of energy and technology to thrive in our economy. It means allowing companies like Tesla to service and finally sell their own cars directly in Texas &mdash; during the 86th session, there was a bill that would have severely limited Tesla and Cummins ability to service their cars and engines, which Nathan would not have supported. He will also fight any measure that restricts this type of freedom for people or businesses to sell directly to their consumers.</p>

                                <h3 id="big">Pro(tect) Life</h3>
                                <p id="p1">To be pro-life is to protect it at all levels &mdash; not just in the womb. Nathan knows this topic draws much debate from both sides and each have their own firebrands. For Nathan, his faith plays a key, foundational role in addressing this issue. Nathan is guided by his belief that human life is sacred and that humans are image-bearers of a gracious and merciful God who loves and cares for each and every one of us.</p>
                                <p id="p2">On the issue of pro-life and pro-choice, Nathan believes there has to be a balance. The landmark Supreme Court case <i>Roe v. Wade</i> is the law of the land. If we actually consider what Roe v. Wade means, then we'll understand there can exist a balance point for an issue like this. Nathan isn't interested in expanding abortion more than what Roe v. Wade already does. Nathan wants to up the ante on sex eduation and get parents involved. If abortions &mdash; which should never be used as a form of birth control &mdash; are to be safe, legal, and rare, we must increase access to contraception and allow birth control to be sold over the counter. Birth control is more than just a 'morning-after pill' &mdash; for some women, it is their way to live normal lives without cyclic pain and can reduce the likelihood of certain cancers. We must also hold our boys accountable just as much as our girls. It takes more than one to create and raise a child, and Texas can do more to reduce maternal poverty and deaths, too.</p>
                                <h3 id="big2">Consistency is Key</h3>
                                <p id="p3">We can't win the issue of life unless we are consistent in our principles. To be pro-life is to also be for ending the death penalty. To be pro-life is to also be for making it easier to adopt and help get children out of the system, not getting stuck in its endless cycle. No child should have to live their life feeling unwanted. If elected, Nathan will work to protect all forms of life, from the living to the yet to be born.</p>
