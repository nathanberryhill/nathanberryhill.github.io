                                <p id="p1">As a Christian, Nathan is guided by his faith in solving an issue as complex and heart-wrenching as criminal justice. Nathan believes justice is actually a faith position. Justice is righting wrongs and restoring good. Nathan believes in a good God who provides our standard for justice and mercy. Without God, there can be no justice. Crime hurts and justice should heal, and public safety should not be for sale in Texas.</p>
                                <p id="p2">As State Representative, Nathan will take the lead by reforming cash bail as we know it. Nathan believes bail reform is not just a left or right issue. He says there is common ground to be found - the Texas bail system is simply not equitable for our citizens because we find that those who don't have financial resources remain in jail, yet those who do have financial resources (and sometimes commit worse crimes) are allowed to be released. Not only is this unequal and discriminatory, this is a threat to our public safety - our bail system allows violent criminals to head back to the streets where they don't belong and become a threat to their victim and community.</p>
                                <h3 id="big2">Retribution vs. Rehabilitation</h3>
                                <p id="p3">In addition to our broken bail system, Nathan recognizes that we have a national drug problem and our prisons are being filled to the doors with nonviolent crimes. Nathan says a smart, 21st-Century solution to drug possession can solve our prison problem. We have to treat our drug problem as a public health crisis with people needing rehabilitation instead of an arrestable and jail-able offense. Working together, we can make the Texas system a shining beacon of smart, effective criminal justice that leads the nation.</p>
